- Profile 'Likes': Enable users to double-tap specific photos or prompts within a profile to 'like' those specific items, rather than the entire profile.
- Ghost Authentication: Develop a custom email/phone authentication flow with animated transitions and a high-end entry screen featuring a subtly moving, abstract 3D mesh background.
- Gamified Onboarding: Implement a step-by-step profile creation process with visual progress bars to encourage complete profile setup.
- Vibe Check: Design a profile layout with a 'Compatibility Radar Chart' that compares a user's personality traits with the viewer's to highlight compatibility.
- AI Icebreaker: Integrate a 'Generate AI Opener' tool within the chat interface to suggest initial messages based on the match's profile.
- Granular Settings: Provide granular settings including Incognito Mode to hide profiles, advanced filters for height, distance, and zodiac signs, and live theme switching.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Gold (#FFD700) for a luxurious feel.
- Background color: Deep OLED black (#000000) for a 'Luxury Dark Mode' aesthetic.
- Accent color: Neon Blue (#13EAC9) to complement the gold and black and provide a modern contrast.
- Body and headline font: 'Poppins', a geometric sans-serif for a contemporary, precise feel.
- Note: currently only Google Fonts are supported.
- Use sleek, minimalist icons with subtle animations on interaction.
- Employ 'Glassmorphism' with blurred overlays and strategic use of negative space.
